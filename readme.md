## Sudoku Solver in Python
This Python script solves Sudoku puzzles with brute force - trying all possible numbers for empty cells until it find a solution that satisfies Sudoku puzzle constraints: rows, columns and blocks.

The script expects an 81 character string as the input for the hints capturing the Sudoku puzzle's rows (empty cells should be 0s) and it outputs an 81 character string of the solution.

## Usage
1. Download the py file.
2. Run the script in command-line.
```
python sudoku.py "800000000003600000070090200050007000000045700000100030001000068008500010090000400"
```
